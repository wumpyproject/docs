# Welcome to the Wumpy project

The Wumpy project is a collection of subpackages under the `wumpy` namespace
for interacting with the Discord API. Wumpy aims to be easy enough for Wumpus,
and extensible enough for Clyde!

## Usage and Getting started

All functionality of the Wumpy project is separated into multiple subpackages,
such as `wumpy-gateway` (imported as `wumpy.gateway`), which each wrap a subset
of the Discord API. This means that you only install the part that you need.

If you are a beginner fear not, there is `wumpy-bot` which makes interacting
with the Discord API using Wumpy as easy as it is with other wrappers!

The easiest way to start using Wumpy is to read the Tutorial at the top. It
goes through many of the core features using Wumpy as a beginner with examples
which you can implement into your bot!

If you are building a new framework or library on top of Wumpy's lowerlevel
subpackages consult the guide on Extending Wumpy and API Reference.

## Support and Community

If you run into any problems, [open a discussion on GitHub][gh-discuss]. This
is the best place to ask for help as only bug reports or detailed feature
requests should go into the issue tracker.

If you are looking into contributing to Wumpy, there is a development
[Discord server][discord] you can join!
