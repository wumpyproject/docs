# Documentation Topics

This section of the documentation offers [*explanations*][diataxis] into
internals and how the library works. The point of these write-ups is to
deepen your understanding of how to work with the library and discuss
design decisions made along the way.

Familiarity with the library is assumed in this section so if you're new to
Wumpy, start by following [the tutorial](../tutorial) and come back when you
have fundamental knowledge.

At first, this section may look a little empty, however it will slowly be
built up over time. Look at the right for a list of articles.
